            <h3>Project Overview</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Project Name: 2.5 MW Solar Power Project for UltraTech Cement</li>
                <li>Capacity: 2.5 MW (25 solar stations of 100 kWp each)</li>
                <li>Locations: 6 facilities across 5 states (Chhattisgarh, Maharashtra, Karnataka,
                    Tamil Nadu, and Rajasthan)
                </li>
                <li>Project Timeline: 5 months</li>
                <li>Objective: To fulfill UltraTech Cement's RPO requirements by generating 
                    0.5% of its total energy from renewable sources.</li>
                <li>Challenges:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Accessing remote locations with limited transport options</li>
                        <li>Customizing design elements for diverse site conditions</li>
                        <li>Managing simultaneous execution across multiple sites</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>

            </ul>
            <h3>Impact and Results</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Total Capacity: The combined capacity of the 25 solar power plants is 2.5 MW.
                    This significant contribution helps UltraTech Cement meet its RPO obligation,
                    ensuring that 0.5% of its total energy consumption comes from renewable 
                    sources.</li>
                <li>Cost Savings: Beyond fulfilling the RPO, the solar power plants have provided
                    energy cost savings for UltraTech Cement. The solar installations not only
                    serve as a cleaner energy source but also reduce the company's reliance
                    on conventional power, lowering long-term energy costs.</li>
                <li>Environmental Impact: By adopting solar energy, UltraTech Cement has 
                    significantly reduced its carbon footprint, supporting the nation's 
                    transition to clean energy and contributing to the broader goal of 
                    sustainability.</li>
