        <p>HMR Institute of Technology & Management (HMRITM), a well-known private engineering and management 
            college in New Delhi, India, is dedicated to both academic excellence and sustainability. In alignment
            with its vision of promoting green energy, HMRITM collaborated with Tata Power Solar to install a 146 
            kW solar rooftop system. This initiative marks a major step in HMRITM's journey towards renewable energy,
            ensuring that the campus operates solely on solar power and minimizing its environmental footprint.
        </p>
        <h3>Objectives</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Sustainability and Energy Independence: To fulfill 100% of the institute's energy requirements through
                renewable sources, making the campus energy-independent.</li>
            <li>Educational Engagement: To provide students with access to live solar projects, enabling practical 
                learning in renewable energy technologies.</li>
            <li>Resource Optimization: To make efficient use of unused roof space on campus by turning it into a
                productive asset.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Project Features: The project includes a rooftop solar system that generates clean, renewable energy, 
            supplying the institute with sufficient power to meet all its energy demands. As the largest installation 
            in the education sector within Delhi-NCR, this solar project serves as a model for other institutions in 
            the region.
        </p>
        <h3>Benefits of the Solar Rooftop System</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Energy Self-Sufficiency: The rooftop solar installation provides 100% of the institute's electricity 
                requirements, contributing to significant cost savings and energy independence.</li>
            <li>Educational Value for Students: HMRITM has set up live solar project facilities that allow students 
                to explore and gain practical knowledge in green technologies.</li>
            <li>Optimal Space Utilization: The installation has repurposed unused roof space, adding value and 
                purpose to previously idle areas.</li>
            <li>Sector Recognition: This installation is the largest of its kind in the Delhi-NCR education sector, 
                marking a significant achievement for the institute.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3> Environmental Impact</h3>
        <p>The rooftop solar system at HMRITM is expected to produce approximately 204,000 units of electricity annually. 
            Over the next 25 years, the system will offset an estimated 3,679 tonnes of carbon emissions. This reduction 
            in carbon footprint reflects the institute's commitment to sustainability and serves as an example of 
            environmental responsibility in the education sector.
