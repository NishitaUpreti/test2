                Tata Power Solar successfully commissioned a 35 kWp solar power plant for the Indian 
                Institute of Astrophysics (IIAP) at the Hanley Observatory, located in Leh, Ladakh. 
                This plant powers India's highest telescope, which is used for solar and stellar 
                observation. The plant was completed in a record time of 9 months and is a key example 
                of Tata Power Solar's expertise in executing solar projects in challenging terrains.

            <h3> Project Overview</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Project Name: 35 kWp Solar Power Plant for IIAP Observatory</li>
                <li>Location: Hanley, Leh, Ladakh</li>
                <li>Timeline: 9 months</li>
                <li>Energy Requirement: Powers India's highest telescope</li>
                <li>Technology: Mono & Multi-Crystalline Modules</li>
                <li>Purpose: Supports solar and stellar observations, provides continuous power for the telescope</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Challenges and Solutions</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Challenging Terrain: The remote location of the observatory posed transport
                    difficulties. Tata Power Solar overcame this by customizing the components
                    for easy transport, utilizing mules and yaks for delivery, ensuring the 
                    plant's performance was not compromised.</li>
                <li>Extreme Weather Conditions: Ladakh experiences extreme and unpredictable 
                    weather, which can impact solar power system efficiency. To address this, 
                    Tata Power Solar designed a temperature-controlled chamber to store the 
                    transformers, protecting the system from harsh weather and ensuring 
                    continuous performance.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Impact</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Uninterrupted Power Supply: The solar plant ensured a reliable and continuous
                    power source for the remotely operated telescope, eliminating the risk of
                    power interruptions that could hinder its operations.</li>
                <li>Cost Savings: The solar installation reduced the dependency on conventional
                    energy sources, saving significant costs related to fuel transport, which
                    was previously difficult and expensive due to the region's tough terrain.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The 35 kWp solar power plant for the IIAP Observatory at Hanley is a remarkable 
                achievement in overcoming geographical and environmental challenges. Tata Power
                Solar's expertise in solar technology provided a sustainable and reliable power
                solution for the highest telescope in India, contributing to both operational
                efficiency and cost savings.</p>
