                Tata Power Solar demonstrated exceptional leadership in solar energy by 
                successfully commissioning a 10 MW solar power plant for Jindal Aluminum Ltd 
                (JAL) in Chitradurga, Karnataka. The plant was executed in a record timeframe of 
                4 months from land acquisition to commissioning. This project was significant not 
                only due to its scale but also because of the challenges posed by the site's complex 
                terrain, which included high wind pressures and rocky, non-agricultural land.

                The Kalamarahalli site, located about 230 km from Bengaluru, is Karnataka's 
                largest solar power plant to date. Through this project, Tata Power Solar showcased
                its ability to deliver high-efficiency solar power systems, solving complex 
                engineering challenges and providing sustainable energy to one of the leading 
                manufacturing companies in India.

            <h3>Project Overview</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Project Name: 10 MW Solar Power Plant for Jindal Aluminum Ltd (JAL)</li>
                <li>Capacity: 10 MW</li>
                <li>Location: Kalamarahalli, near Chitradurga, Karnataka (230 km from Bengaluru)</li>
                <li>Project Timeline: 4 months (January 2012 to June 2013)</li>
                <li>Purpose: To provide sustainable energy to JAL's manufacturing facility 
                    through solar power and support the local community by selling surplus 
                    energy to the Karnataka Electricity Regulatory Commission (KERC).</li>
                <li>Site Size: 51 acres of rocky, non-agricultural land</li>
                <li>Energy Generation: 18,000 MWh (over 10 million units) annually</li>
                <li>Energy Usage: JAL's captive energy needs and surplus energy sold to KERC</li>
                <li>Environmental Impact: Reduces reliance on conventional grid energy and 
                    contributes to cleaner energy in the region</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Challenges and Solutions</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Terrain and Efficiency: The rocky, undulating terrain required a special anchor-type foundation to ensure stability and optimize energy generation through adjustable module tilts.</li>
                <li>High Wind Pressure: To withstand high winds, Tata Power Solar designed reinforced foundations and mounts capable of handling strong winds, ensuring the plant's durability.</li>

            </ul>
            <h3>Impact</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Energy Generation: The plant produces 18,000 MWh annually, meeting JAL's energy needs and supplying surplus power to the local grid, benefiting the surrounding community.</li>
                <li>Community Empowerment: Local communities were trained in construction and maintenance of the plant, providing sustainable livelihoods and contributing to local skill development.</li>
