        </ul>
        <p><b>System Installation Considerations:



        </b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Requires 24-30 m² of roof space with minimal shading.
            </li>
            <li>
                Panels should be oriented south with a 15-20° tilt for optimal sunlight exposure.
        </ul>
        <p><b>Cost Estimation:

        </b></p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Estimated cost: ₹2,36,250 for the system.

            </li>
            <li>
                Additional costs may include permits and grid connectivity.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Government Incentives:

        </b></p>
        <ul>
