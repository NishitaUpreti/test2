            <p>As part of Tata Steel's commitment to sustainability, a 3 MW Solar PV Power Plant was commissioned
                by Tata Power Solar at the Noamundi Iron Ore Mine, marking a major milestone as the first solar 
                power plant at an iron ore mine in India. This innovative project, established through collaboration 
                among Tata Steel, Tata Power Solar, and Tata Power Trading Company, supports Tata Steel's goal to 
                reduce its carbon footprint. The plant will significantly contribute to environmental conservation 
                by reducing CO₂ emissions by approximately 3,000 tonnes per year. This project also highlights Tata 
                Steel's support for global climate action, aligning with the goals of the UN Climate Change Conference 
                Paris 2015 (COP 21).
            </p>
            <h3>Project Overview</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Location: Noamundi Iron Ore Mine, covering 19 acres of reclaimed mining land.</li>
                <li>Capacity: 3 MW solar PV power.</li>
                <li>Technology: Solar PV modules that convert solar radiation into electricity, which is then 
                    converted to AC power and fed into the utility grid through a net metering system.</li>
                <li>Synergy: A collaborative effort among Tata Steel, Tata Power Solar, and Tata Power Trading Company, 
                    demonstrating a unified approach to sustainable energy solutions.</li>
                <li>Special Features: The system is designed to prioritize solar power and only uses grid or diesel 
                    generator (DG) power to make up any shortfall, ensuring green energy usage whenever possible.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Benefits</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Environmental Impact: The facility prioritizes green energy, significantly lowering dependency on 
                    grid and DG power.</li>
                <li>Carbon Emission Reduction: Offsets 3,000 tonnes of CO₂ annually.</li>
                <li>Eco-friendly Site Management: The reclamation of land for solar generation supports biodiversity, 
                    with planned horticulture reducing dust and preserving topsoil.</li>
                <li>Potential for Expansion: The site has potential for generating up to 4.5 MW of solar power, which 
                    could support future expansions of renewable energy capacity.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The 3 MW Solar PV Power Plant at Noamundi Iron Ore Mine is a landmark achievement in India's mining sector.
                By utilizing solar energy in a challenging terrain, Tata Steel and Tata Power Solar have created a model 
                for sustainable power in industrial settings. This project aligns with Tata Steel's commitment to renewable 
                energy and demonstrates how industry can actively contribute to climate action through innovative 
                technologies and partnerships. As a testament to the potential of clean energy, this installation paves 
                the way for broader adoption of solar energy in India's resource-intensive sectors, fostering a future 
                powered by sustainable practice.
