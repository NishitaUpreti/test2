            <p><b>The 2.67 MW Solar Plant at Cochin International Airport is a forward-thinking initiative that integrates renewable energy with innovative infrastructure (solar carports). It not only helps reduce the airport’s carbon footprint but also ensures long-term energy savings. This project is part of CIAL’s commitment to sustainability and energy self-sufficiency, reinforcing its reputation as a pioneer in green aviation and serving as a model for other airports and institutions aiming to reduce their environmental impact.</b></p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Project Overview:</b>The project involves the installation of a 2.67 MW (megawatt) solar power plant in the form of a solar carport at Cochin International Airport (CIAL) in Kerala, India.<br>
                    A solar carport is a structure that combines parking spaces with solar panels, providing both covered parking and generating renewable energy</li>
                <li><b>Energy Generation & Use:</b>The 2.67 MW capacity is sufficient to power a large portion of the airport's energy needs, reducing its reliance on the grid.<br>
                    The generated solar energy is used for the airport's operational requirements, including lighting, air conditioning, and other systems, reducing the overall electricity costs and ensuring sustainability in airport operations.</li>The 2.67 MW solar plant generates approximately 3.9 million kWh (kilowatt-hours) of electricity annually.
                <li><b> Environmental Impact:</b>The project significantly reduces the airport's carbon footprint and supports India's renewable energy goals.<br>
                    By utilizing solar power, CIAL contributes to India’s commitment to a greener and more sustainable future.The solar installation is expected to offset approximately 3,300 tons of CO₂ emissions per year.
                    </li>
                <li><b> Sustainability & Cost Savings:</b>The project significantly reduces the airport's carbon footprint and supports India's renewable energy goals.<br>
                    By utilizing solar power, CIAL contributes to India’s commitment to a greener and more sustainable future.
                    </li>
                <li><b>Innovative Design:</b>The project significantly reduces the airport's carbon footprint and supports India's renewable energy goals.<br>
                    By utilizing solar power, CIAL contributes to India’s commitment to a greener and more sustainable future.
                    </li>
                <li><b> Pioneering Green Airport:</b>The project significantly reduces the airport's carbon footprint and supports India's renewable energy goals.<br>
                    By utilizing solar power, CIAL contributes to India’s commitment to a greener and more sustainable future.
                    </li>
                <li><b> Broader Impact:</b>The project significantly reduces the airport's carbon footprint and supports India's renewable energy goals.<br>
                    By utilizing solar power, CIAL contributes to India’s commitment to a greener and more sustainable future.
                    </li>
                <li><b>Financial Investment:</b>
                    The total investment in the project was around INR 14.5 crores (approximately USD 1.8 million).
                    The cost of the installation is expected to be recovered over a period of about 5-6 years through energy savings.</li>
